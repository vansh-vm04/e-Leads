# Buyer Lead Intake App

This project is a Buyer Lead Intake web application built with **Next.js**, **React Hook Form**, **Zod**, and **Prisma**.

It allows users to submit buyer leads with validation, rate limiting, and error boundaries. The app is designed for server-side rendering (SSR) where possible and enforces ownership rules for updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Design Notes

### Validation
- All form fields are validated using **Zod** + **React Hook Form**.  
- Server-side validation is added in the API layer to ensure data consistency.

### SSR vs Client
- The app uses **SSR** for rendering initial pages.  
- Form interactions and validation happen on the **client side**.

### Ownership Enforcement
- Users can only update or delete the leads they created.  
- Auth middleware checks for user ID on sensitive actions.

### Error Boundary + Empty State
- Error boundary component wraps pages to catch rendering errors.  
- Empty state components handle cases when no leads are available.
